# TTT-GravityGun

An addon that reimagines the classic Gravity Gun into a lua swep for [trouble in terrorist town](http://ttt.badking.net/), a [garry's mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/) gamemode.

It can be found on the steam workshop [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1414206909), and the project was somewhat adopted from it's original author, [mka0207](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197996267438)

Repository is currently empty and w.i.p (the workshop addon is too, for that matter) for the time being, but won't be soon.
